# Project Portfolio Website
A React App built to serve a single page website showing a simple resume and portfolio. The data that appears on the webpage can easily be changed and updated with the `src/config.js` file.

## Pre-requisites
To run this website on your local machine you should have a stable version of [node.js](https://www.nodejs.org) and npm installed.

## Getting Started
To get started running this app on your local machine you should clone this repository into your desired location.
```
git clone https://github.com/
```


Once cloned, navigate to the root of the project and install all of the required packages
```
npm install
```

You are now ready to run the server on your local host.
```
npm start
```

## How to modify the data in the website
I have included a `config.js` file which holds a single json object called inputData. This holds all of the information displayed on the webpage.
